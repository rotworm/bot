Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit

Welcome to BlackdProxy for Tibia.
If you only want to use this program for cheats, basic instructions are:
1) close all Tibias
2) open this proxy
3) open all Tibias you like
4) play Tibia now

It is highly recommended that you limit your Tibia framerate so it doesn't eat 100 % of the 
CPU . A stable fps will be a good signal. This change can be done in 
Options/Graphics/Advanced/Adjust framerate limit
